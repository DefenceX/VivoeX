# Video Pipelines
The HMI deals with RTP video streams only to add additinal capabilities to the HMI then video [pipelining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)) is required.

We will leverage a streaming pipeline framework called Gstreamer to manipulate video sources and some example pipleines are shown in the sections below. For more sophisticated AI and ML pipelines then Nvidia has its Deepstream SDK extending the gstreamer framework with plugins for extending the capabilities of Gstreamer.
